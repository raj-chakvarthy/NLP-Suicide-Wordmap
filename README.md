# NLP-Suicide-Wordmap
This is a samll part closely resembling one of my personal project which is yet to be completed. The poject aims to analyze tweets containing words which depeict that the student is depressed and help identify schools to find out depressed students and provide them necessary help or counselling.

In this piece of code I am finding tweets that contains the word Suicide and extract the words from those tweets and create a word map. The wordmap will contain the words of tweets containg the word 'Suicide', in a way it represents what people associate with the word 'suicide'.
